	<h3>Soul Harvest thanks:</h3>
	<b>Eric St-Cyr</b><br />
	Over the years Eric has helped out a bunch in various aspects, playing the role of bassist, keyboardist, brother, manager, producer, recording engineer, booking agent, and rock and roll god.  His current project, twelve34, will be seeing some more Soul Harvest members joining up as twelve34 continues to rock it out.
	<br /><br />
	<b>K10 "Rockstar" Lewis</b><br />
	The princess of rock and roll, Kristen helped bring the band a whole new sound and feel back in 2000 and the whole band had a great time touring the bar circuit and backing up such a wonderful voice.  It was a sad day when Soul Harvest and Kristen parted ways, but we'll always have those few years, and all those beers, to remind us of the good days!
	<br /><br />
	Keep on rockin', K10, don't let "the man" get you down. :)
	<br /><br />
	<b>Seb Callendar</b><br />
	The first bassist ever in Soul Harvest, and the man who introduced us to perennial Soul Harvest drummer Chris Amos.  Hell, even after we booted him out of the band (we are such BASTARDS!) he still came out to a few shows.  Thanks man!<br /><br />
	<b>Lisa Kelly</b><br />
	There aren't enough ways we can thank Lisa for all the things she's done for us over the years.  Live photographs, photoshoots, even going to the recording studio with us and staying up way too late during overnighters just to get a few choice shots of the recording process.  Lisa even reviewed The Rift for us, and made us special sugar cookies to keep us going during those allnighters at the studio!!  You were too good to us :)<br /><br />
	<b>Angela</b><br />
	Yet another of our close friends who supported us so much she married the drummer!!!  Yes ladies, follow her lead and you too can have your very own rock star!  This wonderful woman has put up with all the practices and shows that take her man away from her, and has done more then her fair share of coming out to shows and cheering us on.  There's nothing quite like being at a wedding between friends, and having the whole band there to celebrate along with them.  Truly special moments in Soul Harvest history!<br /><br />
	<b>Davey Boy</b><br />
	The only man to ever own an original Soul Harvest t-shirt, this man was our roadie, good friend, and consummate audience-member.  This dude even videotaped shows just so we could laugh at how goofy we were on stage!  Dave, you rock, and I'm sure we haven't seen the last of that videocam of yours at twelve34 shows!<br /><br />
	<b>Jonny Arthur</b><br />
	Big Red's been a good friend for years, and back when Soul Harvest pretended to be a blues band Jonny even came on board and helped us make things just a little different.  With raspy vocals and a harmonica, the big man gave it his all and I'm glad to still count him as one of my dearest pals, even if Soul Harvest did have to let him go as we pursued a new sound.
	<br /><br />
	<b>Dave Van Soest</b><br />
	The first real front-man Soul Harvest ever had, Dave left for Edmonton after only 3 shows with Soul Harvest, but he left his mark on the recordings done for The Rift in August 1999.  Sure, he left town and stranded us without a singer.  And yeah, he took my good buddy Sean out with him.  On second thought, NO THANK YOU'S FOR DAVE... that no-good low-down dirty scoundrel. :)<br /><br />
	<b>Sean "Because I'm Irish" McCullough</b><br />
	Dude. Tripwire? C'mon.  What kind of a band name is that? "Soul Harvest" is much more 'happening' and 'with-it'. :)  Sean, my good friend, started this band with me way back in '97, and we wrote way too many crappy (and some less crappy) tunes then I care to count.  Still, we had a great time, and some of those songs were still being played by Soul Harvest almost 7 years later.  Sean may have left us to venture out to the lands of Edmonton, Alberta, but the band has always remembered its roots.  How could you forget the man when every show has "Sean's Song" in the setlist ;)
	<br /><br />
	If you're ever in the Edmonton area, try to catch Sean's band Tripwire.  They do some great music...<br /><br />
	<b>The Amos family</b><br />
	Those poor people.... for years we held practices in drummer Chris' home, his poor parents listening to us bash away and make a lot of noise trying to figure out our musical creations.  Those saints let us complete strangers into their house and it became like a second home for some of us.  We may not have thanked you enough for your patience over the years, but hopefully you know how indebted we are for your kindnesses (and occasional treats ;) )<br /><br />
	<b>Mom and Dad St-Cyr</b><br />
	When practices weren't being held at the Amos household, they were invariably making their presence felt at the St-Cyr residence.  Home to many bands over the years, Soul Harvest played their first 'performance' in that basement, trying out new material way back in 1997.  It was an... 'interesting'... experience :)
	<br /><br />
	Even though it has been a few years, it still feels strange to write about my dad... a caring man who never seemed to have a harsh word to say to any of his loved ones.  I miss him dearly, and he was taken too early from this world.  I wish he could have had the chance to see both his sons on Barrymore's stage, or watch them graduate from university and college, but such was not meant to be.  I still remember coming upstairs from an afternoon practice to find my dad doing some sort of housework and singing the words to Chillin' On the Patio, a big smile on his face.  Those are the memories I hold onto, and I thank him for being there to support us in our music.
	<br /><br />
	My mother, with much patience, put up with all that musical racket for many years.  She supported us whenever possible, helped us out when needed, and allowed both her sons to follow the paths they needed to.  I can't thank her enough for all the times she let my loud friends into the home to plug in electric guitars and make what could sometimes only loosely be referred to as 'music'. :)  You rock, mom!
	<br /><br />
	<b>Friends and family</b><br />
	There are a bunch of you who've come to our shows, given us your time and money, and lent us your ears.  All of you made the Soul Harvest experience what it was.  We can't thank everyone individually, but know that we appreciate everything everyone did for us, and all the words of praise (deserved or not!) that you gave us, even when we played like crap!
	<br /><br />
	I always like to quote this when thinking of how you all have helped us (the non-tomatoes version):
	<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	<i>"What would you do if I sang out of tune?<br />
	Would you stand up and walk out on me?<br />
	Lend me your ear and I'll sing you a song,<br />
	And I'll try not to sing out of key.<br />
	Oh I get by with a little help from my friends."<br />
</blockquote>
