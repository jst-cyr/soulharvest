<b>(instrumental intro)</b>

<b>Verse 1:</b>
D      |D             |D             |D
Virgil Spencer's got a nineteen inch Hitachi

D/c    |D/c           |D             |D
And many deamons lingering

D      |D                |D                |D
Friday night he pulled a gun to change the channel

D/c              |D/c        |D           |D
Something that he picked up from the King

C                  |C                  |D                  |D
His wife remembers well the man she knew

C         |C                  |Bm                 |Bm
Seems the dreams she had have all turned black and blue, she's

Am   |Am   |G     |G
wasted     years     No

F   |F     |Em   |Em
time   for tears 'Cause there's


<br><b>Chorus</b>
D       |C         |G      |D
another chance and someday soon

D       |C         |G    |D
Shining like the Alabama moon 

      D       |C      |G       |D
She's looking for her promised land

D     |C                  G -> D    D->C
Out beyond the lights of ...............

Birmingham

<b>Verse3:</b>
C                          |C              |D                  |D
And as the rain falls down upon the interstate

C         |C                  |Bm                 |Bm
Any doubts she had are all but washed away

Am   |Am   |G     |G
One long look back

F   |F     |Em   |Em
at Bir....ming....ham 'Cause there's
