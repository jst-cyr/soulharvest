<b>VERSE1:</b>
Now the setting sun is way too strong
my eyes can't see the light.
It said that I shouldn't be afraid
to go out with a fight.

<b>VERSE2:</b>
I see the slight dawn of the night
can't believe it came.
It said that I should be around
so that I would know no shame.

<b>BRIDGE1:</b>
And as I look into the mirror
I catch a glimpse of you
sayin':

<b>CHORUS1:</b>
But you've seen the game
why do you still remain
just to play it now.
But you've seen the game
why do you still remain
Look away and run for now.

<b>VERSE3:</b>
I seem too late to realize
what really was the game.
And now I seem to be around
just to do it all again.

<b>VERSE4:</b>
I came to help you one last time
you need to make it count.
Cause when I'm gone, I can't be there
just to laugh it all about.

<b>BRIDGE2:</b>
But as the light glints off the glass
I see the times run by
sayin':

(chorus1, first half)

<b>CHORUS2:</b>
Is it all the same
why does it never change
cause I think it can.

(break, instrumental and vocal)

Is it all the same
why does it never change
All we need is a place to land.
