<b>[Verse 1]</b>
25 years of my life and still
Tryin' to to get up that great big hill of 
Hope, for a destination.
I realized quickly when I knew I should 
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man, 
For whatever that means.

<b>[Chorus]</b>
And so I cry sometimes, when I'm lying in bed
just to get all out, what's in my head,
And I, I am feeling, a little peculiar.
And so I wake in the morning, and I step outside 
And I take a deep breath, and I get real high, 
And I, scream from the top of my lungs, "What's going on?" 
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."  
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, "Hey yeah yeah hey, hey yeah yeah."
I said, "Hey, what's going on?"

<b>[ooo oo oo etc.]</b>

<b>[Verse 2]</b>
And I try, oh my god, do I try 
I try all the time, in this institution.
And I pray, oh my god, do I pray
I pray every single day, for a revolution.

<b>(chorus x2)</b>
<b>[ooo ooo oo etc.]</b>

<b>[Verse 3]</b>
25 years of my life and still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination
