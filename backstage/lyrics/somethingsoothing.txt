Something Soothing
*************************
[Verse 1]
4am , I wake up with my dreams
Trying to forget all of what it means
Soft lips whispered something soothing I didn't hear
Lying so close, not anywhere near

[Chorus]
Been a long time growing up my dear
It took too long to see
That we're no longer innocent

[Verse2: Instrumental]

(Chorus)
(Chorus: Instrumental)

[Verse 3]
4am and I'm sitting waiting for the dawn
Moonlight hovering over a new winter's snow
The chimes echo the soul my heart fakes
Waiting in the cold to hear something soothing
Something soothing
Something soothing
Something soothing

(Chorus: Instrumental) x2
