    <pre>
  People living their lives for you on TV
  They say they're better than you and you agree
  He says hold my calls from behind those covered crosses
  come here boy... there ain't nothing for free
  Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill
  Another cute cheap thrill, you know you love him if you put him in
  your will

  CHORUS: Who will save your soul when it comes to the flower
  Who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy
  Who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
  
  We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them
  The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
  Another day, another dollar, another war,
  another tower went up to where the homeless had their homes
  So we pray to as many different gods are there are
  flowers but we call religion our friend
  We're so worried about saving our souls
  Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin

  (chorus)

  Interlude -  E

  Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their
  kill... you get social security, but it doesn't pay your bills
  There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
  So you bargain with the Devil, say you're o.k. for today,
  You say that you love them, take their money and run
  Say, it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those
  things, those flings, those strings you've got to cut,
  So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts.    

  (chorus)
