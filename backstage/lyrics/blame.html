<b>Verse 1:</b>
<br>
    It seems that we don't fight anymore<br>
    Maybe that's cuz we don't talk at all<br>
    You say "Don't let the door hit your ass when you go"<br>
    It used to be magic in the air<br>
    We said it would last forever<br>
    Well how long is forever anyways?<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus 1:</b>
<br>
    Maybe I knew too late<br>
    Maybe I never treated you right<br>
    Maybe I was just wasting time<br>
    Or maybe it's you<br>
<br>
<b>(instrumental)</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Verse 2:</b>
<br>
    And now our friends have gone their own ways<br>
    Leaving us alone to deal with this<br>
    Maybe we can just forget it for today?<br>
    It's a dream we don't walk anymore<br>
    Wish I could say it's you I'll miss<br>
    But it's time to get on out the door<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus 2:</b>
<br>
    Maybe I knew too late<br>
    Maybe I never treated you right<br>
    Maybe I was just wasting time<br>
    Or maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
<br>
<b>(instrumental)</b>

<br>
<b>Breakdown:</b>
<br>
    The moon don't hit my eye like it used to<br>
    So I'm grabbing the next train outta here<br>
    Moving on, moving up, getting out, I'll be fine<br>
    Maybe I'll forget you one of these years<br>

    Ooo oo oo etc.<br>
<br>
<b>(instrumental build up toprevious beat and tempo)</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus 3:</b>
<br>
    Maybe I knew too late<br>
    Maybe I never treated you right<br>
    Maybe I was just wasting time<br>
    I was wasting time on you<br>
    Maybe I knew always<br>
    And maybe I always treated you right<br>
    And maybe I wasn't wasting my time<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>    </font>
