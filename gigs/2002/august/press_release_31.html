	<i><b>What</b></i> : It’s Eric’s birthday! Who’s Eric? He’s the president of Auto-Wah Records, home to some of Ottawa’s fine acts, such as Ignition, Soul Harvest and Uncapable. So it’s his birthday party, and everybody is invited to raise money for this good cause!
	<br /><br />

	<i><b>When</b></i> : Saturday, August 31<SUP>st</SUP>, 2002. The show will start at 9pm.
	<br /><br />

	<i><b>Where</b></i> : This birthday benefit bash will be held @ Babylon Night Club on Bank St. For more info about the club check out <a href="http://www.babylonclub.com" target="_new">www.babylonclub.com</a>
	<br /><br />

	<i><b>Why</b></i> : Now this is the most important part, why is this being held? Well, these four bands are going to be providing you with entertainment for the evening, in their attempt to raise money for the Cancer Society of Canada. For more info about the charity please check out <a href="http://www.cancer.ca" target="_new">www.cancer.ca</a>. The idea of the show is that there is no cover charge, but we will be accepting donations all night. The theory behind that is that some people can only spare a quarter, while others can hopefully spare much more!
