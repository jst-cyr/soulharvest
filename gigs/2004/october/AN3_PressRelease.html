<h4>Animal Noises III set to roar in the nation's capital</h4>

Ottawa, ON. - September 13, 2004 - Animal Noises III, the third in a series of
annual concerts to benefit the Ottawa Humane Society, is this year scheduled to
feature three of Ottawa's hottest independent musical acts. Taking place on
Saturday, October 9, 2004 at Babylon Nightclub (317 Bank Street), Animal Noises III
will include performances by <a href="http://www.soulharvest.ca">Soul Harvest</a>, <a href="http://www.flow14.ca">Flow14</a>, and <a href="http://www.splitfingerband.com">Splitfinger</a>. Fulfilling the duties of host and master of ceremonies will be Eric Longley of CJOH-TV.
<br /><br />

Based in the national capital region, the Animal Noises initiative is a local
fundraising effort supported by Ottawa musicians, businesses, media outlets, and
volunteers. "Ottawa's been a great city for supporting the cause of animal welfare
as shown by Animal Noises raising over $2,000 last year," says Patrick Calnan,
founder of the benefit concert series. This unique alliance of disparate groups
across the city has produced two successful concerts and a live CD that have
generated valuable financial support for the cause of animal welfare.
