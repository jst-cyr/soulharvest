<b>Sean "Because I'm Irish" McCullough</b><br />
Dude. Tripwire? C'mon.  What kind of a band name is that? "Soul Harvest" is much more 'happening' and 'with-it'. :)  Sean, my good friend, started this band with me way back in '97, and we wrote way too many crappy (and some less crappy) tunes then I care to count.  Still, we had a great time, and some of those songs were still being played by Soul Harvest almost 7 years later.  Sean may have left us to venture out to the lands of Edmonton, Alberta, but the band has always remembered its roots.  How could you forget the man when every show has "Sean's Song" in the setlist ;)

If you're ever in the Edmonton area, try to catch Sean's band Tripwire.  They do some great music...
