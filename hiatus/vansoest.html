<b>Dave Van Soest</b><br />
The first real front-man Soul Harvest ever had, Dave left for Edmonton after only 3 shows with Soul Harvest, but he left his mark on the recordings done for The Rift in August 1999.  Sure, he left town and stranded us without a singer.  And yeah, he took my good buddy Sean out with him.  On second thought, NO THANK YOU'S FOR DAVE... that no-good low-down dirty scoundrel. :)
