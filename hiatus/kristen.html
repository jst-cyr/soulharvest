<b>K10 "Rockstar" Lewis</b><br />
The princess of rock and roll, Kristen helped bring the band a whole new sound and feel back in 2000 and the whole band had a great time touring the bar circuit and backing up such a wonderful voice.  It was a sad day when Soul Harvest and Kristen parted ways, but we'll always have those few years, and all those beers, to remind us of the good days!

Keep on rockin', K10, don't let "the man" get you down. :)
