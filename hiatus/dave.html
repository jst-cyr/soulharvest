<b>Davey Boy</b><br />
The only man to ever own an original Soul Harvest t-shirt, this man was our roadie, good friend, and consummate audience-member.  This dude even videotaped shows just so we could laugh at how goofy we were on stage!  Dave, you rock, and I'm sure we haven't seen the last of that videocam of yours at twelve34 shows!
