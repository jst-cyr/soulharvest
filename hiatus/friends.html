<b>Friends and family</b><br />
There are a bunch of you who've come to our shows, given us your time and money, and lent us your ears.  All of you made the Soul Harvest experience what it was.  We can't thank everyone individually, but know that we appreciate everything everyone did for us, and all the words of praise (deserved or not!) that you gave us, even when we played like crap!
<br /><br />
I always like to quote this when thinking of how you all have helped us (the non-tomatoes version):
<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	<i>"What would you do if I sang out of tune?<br />
	Would you stand up and walk out on me?<br />
	Lend me your ear and I'll sing you a song,<br />
	And I'll try not to sing out of key.<br />
	Oh I get by with a little help from my friends."<br />
</blockquote>
