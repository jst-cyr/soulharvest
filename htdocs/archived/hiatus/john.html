<b>Jonny Arthur</b><br />
Big Red's been a good friend for years, and back when Soul Harvest pretended to be a blues band Jonny even came on board and helped us make things just a little different.  With raspy vocals and a harmonica, the big man gave it his all and I'm glad to still count him as one of my dearest pals, even if Soul Harvest did have to let him go as we pursued a new sound.
