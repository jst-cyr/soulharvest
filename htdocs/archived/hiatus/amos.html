<b>The Amos family</b><br />
Those poor people.... for years we held practices in drummer Chris' home, his poor parents listening to us bash away and make a lot of noise trying to figure out our musical creations.  Those saints let us complete strangers into their house and it became like a second home for some of us.  We may not have thanked you enough for your patience over the years, but hopefully you know how indebted we are for your kindnesses (and occasional treats ;) )
