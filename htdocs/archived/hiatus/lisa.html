<b>Lisa Kelly</b><br />
There aren't enough ways we can thank Lisa for all the things she's done for us over the years.  Live photographs, photoshoots, even going to the recording studio with us and staying up way too late during overnighters just to get a few choice shots of the recording process.  Lisa even reviewed The Rift for us, and made us special sugar cookies to keep us going during those allnighters at the studio!!  You were too good to us :)
