<b>Mom and Dad St-Cyr</b><br />
When practices weren't being held at the Amos household, they were invariably making their presence felt at the St-Cyr residence.  Home to many bands over the years, Soul Harvest played their first 'performance' in that basement, trying out new material way back in 1997.  It was an... 'interesting'... experience :)

Even though it has been a few years, it still feels strange to write about my dad... a caring man who never seemed to have a harsh word to say to any of his loved ones.  I miss him dearly, and he was taken too early from this world.  I wish he could have had the chance to see both his sons on Barrymore's stage, or watch them graduate from university and college, but such was not meant to be.  I still remember coming upstairs from an afternoon practice to find my dad doing some sort of housework and singing the words to Chillin' On the Patio, a big smile on his face.  Those are the memories I hold onto, and I thank him for being there to support us in our music.

My mother, with much patience, put up with all that musical racket for many years.  She supported us whenever possible, helped us out when needed, and allowed both her sons to follow the paths they needed to.  I can't thank her enough for all the times she let my loud friends into the home to plug in electric guitars and make what could sometimes only loosely be referred to as 'music'. :)  You rock, mom!
