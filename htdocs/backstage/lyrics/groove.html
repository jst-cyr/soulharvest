GROOVE IS IN THE HEART
Dee-Lite
                      You're going to dance
                      You're going to dance
                      You're going to dance
                      And have some fun


                      Dig


                      The chills that you spill up my back
                      keep me filled with satisfaction when we're done
                      satisfaction of what's to come


                      I couldn't ask for another
                      No, I couldn't ask for another


                      Another try


                      Your groove, I do deeply dig
                      No walls, only the bridge, my supperdish
                      My succotash wish


                      Singing, baby
                      I couldn't ask for another
                      No, I couldn't ask for another


                      Groove is in the heart, Groove is in the heart
                      Groove is in the heart, Groove is in the heart


                      Watch out!


                      The depth of hula groove
                      Move us to the nth hoop
                      We're going thru to, Horten hears a who


                      I couldn't ask for another
                      No, I couldn't ask for another


                      DJ Soul was on a roll
                      I been told he can't be sold
                      Not vicious or malicious
                      Just de-lovely and delicious


                      I couldn't ask for another
                      No, I couldn't ask for another


                      Groove is in the heart...
