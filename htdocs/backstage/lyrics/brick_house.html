Uh, mmm, mmm, mmm

(instrumental intro)

She's a brick house
She's mighty mighty just letting it all hang out
She's a brick house 
I like ladies stacked and that's a fact, ain't holding nothing back
She's a brick house
When we're together, everybody knows
This is how the story goes

She knows she's got everything
That a woman needs to get a man, yeah, yeah
How can she lose, with the stuff she use
36-24-36 OW! What a winning hand

She's a brick house
She's mighty mighty just letting it all hang out
She's a brick house 
I like ladies stacked and that's a fact, ain't holding nothing back
She's a brick house
Yeah she's the one, the only one built like an amazon

The clothes she wear, her sexy ways
Make a old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built, and knows how to please
Sho'nuff to knock a strong man to his knees

Cuz she's a brick house
She's mighty mighty just letting it all hang out
A brick house 
I like ladies stacked and that's a fact, ain't holding nothing back

Shake it down, shake it down, down
Shake it down, shake it down, down etc.

Brick house.
She's mighty mighty just letting it all hang out
Ow, a brick house.
Yeah she's the one, the only one built like an amazon

Shaka ga shaka ow now... etc.
SHAKE IT!
Shaka ga shaka ow now... etc.
SHAKE IT!

(instrumental)

OW! A Brick house!
