<b>VERSE1:</b>
Down at the department store, 
A little boy, can't be more than four.
And he's lost his mommy.
Looking around for a face he might know,
[A line I can't remember is here]
THere's bustling strangers all around.
That little boy is crying.
That little boy is crying.
That little boy is....
Cry-y-y-y-ing.


<b>CHORUS:</b>
What a way to grow up,
What a way to lose your way
What a way to learn distrust
And lose your faith....
One more step in growing up

<b>VERSE2:</b>
Hiding behind the Christmas tree,
A little girl, can't be more than seven.
And it's way past her bedtime.
Sees someone putting something in her stocking
It's her daddy, he says:
"The girls are gonna love what Santa brings this year"
And daddy's girl is crying.
Daddy's girl is crying.
Daddy's girl is....
Cry-y-y-y-ing.

<b>(chorus)</b>

(instrumental solo over verse chords)

<b>VERSE3:</b>
Junior High School dance,
A boy, at least 12 years old.
And he's out in the hall with Suzie.
Latest music is floating in the air,
He's getting his first kiss.
But Suzie just wants to be friends.
And that boy is crying,
And that boy is crying,
And that boy is...
Cry-y-y-y-ing.

<b>(chorus)</b>

<b>OUTRO:</b>
Father... don't let your children... cry.
