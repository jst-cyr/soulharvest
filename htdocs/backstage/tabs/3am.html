<b>(intro)</b>
G Cadd9 (guitar walk-down)
G Cadd9 (guitar walk-down)
G Cadd9 (4x)

<b>Verse1:</b>
D             Cadd9                            G Cadd9  G Cadd9
She says it's cold outside and she hands me my raincoat
D             Cadd9                            G Cadd9  G Cadd9
She's always worried about things like that.
D             Cadd9                            G Cadd9  G Cadd9
She says it's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault
D             Cadd9                            
And she only sleeps when it's raining
D             Cadd9                           
And she screams and her voice is straining

<b>Chorus:</b>
         G    D  Cadd9
She says baby
                    G    D  Cadd9
It's 3 am I must be lonely
              G    D  Cadd9
When she says baby
                                       G         D
Well I can't help but be scared of it all sometimes
          Cadd9
Says the rain's gonna wash away I believe it

G Cadd9 (4x)

<b>Verse2 (same as first)</b>

<b>(chorus)</b>

(instrumental break)
G Cadd9 (4x)

<b>Verse3:</b>
She belives that life is made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days, and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway
     D                   Cadd9
But outside it's stopped raining
