<b>Verse 1:</b>
<br>
Bb   F            Eb        D     C<br>
    It seems that we don't fight anymore<br>
Bb        F            Eb                 D     C<br>
    Maybe that's cuz we don't talk at all<br>
Bb        F                Eb            D   C<br>
    You say "Don't let the door hit your ass when<br>
Bb        F      Eb         D   C<br>
    you go"<br>
Bb   F         Eb   D     C<br>
    It used to be magic in the air<br>
Bb        F            Eb    D  C<br>
    We said it would last forever<br>
Bb       F           Eb     D  C<br>
    Well how long is forever anyways?<br>
Bb       F           Eb<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus 1:</b>
<br>
Dm        F<br>
    Maybe I knew too late<br>
Dm        F<br>
    Maybe I never treated you right<br>
Dm        F          Eb<br> (hold and pause)
    Maybe I was just wasting time<br>
    Or maybe it's you<br>
<br>
<b>(instrumental)</b>
Bb       F           Eb     D  C<br>
Bb       F           Eb     D  C<br>
Bb       F           Eb     D  C<br>
Bb       F           Eb     D  C<br>

<b>Breakdown:</b>
<br>
Bb          Bb            F             F<br>
    The moon don't hit my eye like it used to<br>
Bb          Bb            F             F<br>
    So I'm grabbing the next train outta here<br>
Bb          Bb            F             F<br>
    Moving on, moving up, getting out, I'll be fine<br>
Bb          Bb            F             F<br>
    Maybe I'll forget you one of these years<br>
    Ooo oo oo etc.<br>
<br>
<b>(instrumental build up toprevious beat and tempo)</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Chorus 3:</b> (same music as first, twice as long)
<br>
    Maybe I knew too late<br>
    Maybe I never treated you right<br>
    Maybe I was just wasting time<br>
    I was wasting time on you<br>
    Maybe I knew always<br>
    And maybe I always treated you right<br>
    And maybe I wasn't wasting my time<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
    Maybe it's you<br>
