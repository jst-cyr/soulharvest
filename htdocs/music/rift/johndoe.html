    <br><br>
    "Comes back and she's not there <br>
     Not a note anywhere <br>
     He falls back into a chair <br>
     She's gone"<br><br>
     This fictional ballad was one of the first tunes written for Soul Harvest. Using a very simple repetitive structure, the song takes the listener through the tale of the poor soul John Doe, written to be the "anyman" that we can all recognize, either in ourselves or in someone we know. <br><Br>
     One of the most lyrically impressive songs in the Soul Harvest set, this song is rarely played live by the band and can usually only be heard on the band's various recordings.  <br><br>
     This track showcases the guitar work of Sean McCullough and Jason St-Cyr, with impromptu bass guitar by Ryan Lindsay and the drum stylings of Chris Amos. Dave Van Soest lends his voice to the mix on this track which appearend on the 1999 album "The Rift", which can be purchased through the band by contacting them via email: soul_harvest@geocities.com
